## Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash

â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logo.svg

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   |  blog/
â”‚   â”‚   |    â””â”€â”€ some-blog-posts.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
